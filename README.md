  ## **Description**
    
  Every good project has a team working together behind it. This Command Line Interface app aims to be a useful tool for teams to keep track of contact information and roles for each team-member to easily access in one location.  

  The CLI keeps it simple for the user to just answer a few information prompts, and the app does the rest. Teams will have a sleek, useful page in no time.
